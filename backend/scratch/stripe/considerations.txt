if your customer backs out of the checkout process and adds new items to their cart, you may need to update the amount when they start the checkout process again.
If the checkout process is interrupted and resumes later, attempt to reuse the same PaymentIntent instead of creating a new one. Each PaymentIntent has a unique ID that you can use to retrieve it if you need it again. 
In the data model of your application, you can store the ID of the PaymentIntent on the customerâ€™s shopping cart or session to facilitate retrieval. The benefit of reusing the PaymentIntent is that the object state helps track any failed payment attempts for a given cart or session.
